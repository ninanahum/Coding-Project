    <p> The ALDO Group is one of the world’s leading fashion retailers, with more than 20,000 associates worldwide and nearly 200 million customers visiting our stores each year. Specializing in the design and production of quality, stylish and accessible footwear and accessories, the ALDO Group has an unsurpassed knowledge of the shoe retail business. This expertise has enabled us to cover all corners of the footwear market with three signature brands: ALDO, CALL IT SPRING and GLOBO. While all distinct in character, the ALDO Group family of brands all beat with the same heart - an energetic core containing the spirit and vision of one man and his dream.

Since the very first ALDO store opened its doors in downtown Montreal in 1972, this pioneering company has gone from one strength to another, consistently striving to be the best it can be for its customers. In 1993, we sought to bring our product and our brand beyond the Canadian borders and we opened our first store in the U.S. This was closely followed by the first franchise store in Israel in 1995, and we have not slowed down since. The ALDO Group now has more than 3,000 points of sale around the globe, operating on all continents except Antarctica.</p>
